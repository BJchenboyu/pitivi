# Git repositories

See [Git](Git.md) for instructions on how to deal with our
repositories.

# Official (GNOME) repository

You should clone and make your own branches based on this repository:
<git://git.gnome.org/pitivi>

-   Web view: <http://git.gnome.org/pitivi>

Note that git being a decentralized version control system, you [do not
need commit access](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8#t=19m13s)
to this repository to contribute to the project! You can easily make
your own branch and get it merged into master (we have an official
project policy to review your contributions within three weeks).

Lack of activity in the main repository does not mean there is no
development activity going on (it can be happening in other repositories
below).

## Old pitivi.org repository

git.pitivi.org was previously the official repository. You should now be
using the GNOME one instead.
