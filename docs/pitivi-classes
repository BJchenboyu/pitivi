** graphical Classes
----

   Here we see the different high-level graphical classes available in the application.
They mostly represent windows, and as such derivate from GtkWindow.

   All of those windows contain a reference to the PitiviMainApp, nevertheless, we can 
see two different types of windows :
    - Windows that are only instanciated once, which are global to the application.
    - Windows that are specific to a given project, whose contents depend on the
      selected project.
   Some of those windows can also be *Settings windows, which only appear temporarily.
