# Test suite wishlist

This page is meant as a TODO list for new contributors interested in the
[test suite](Testing.md), and for ourselves. Feel free to
tackle any of these items, to add your own, or ask for help/guidance.

-   Undo/redo tests for each case the user can undo/redo.
-   Tests for each timeline operation
    -   Copy/paste
    -   Split
    -   Group/ungroup
