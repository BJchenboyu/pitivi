Pre-requisites:
 * 'make check' passes
 * 'make dist' passes
 * Do a test installation and make sure all files are properly dist-ed/install-ed
 * No 'blocker' tasks against the upcoming milestone in phabricator


Preparing:
    Pre-releases:
     * Bump version number up in meson.build (ex: 0.96.0.1 -> 0.97)
     * Update the dependencies' version numbers in pitivi/check.py
     * Re configure
     * Make sure pre-requisites are still valid
     * Commit

    Releases (major or bugfixes):
     * Bump minor number up in meson.build and remove the nano (ex: 0.15.92 -> 0.16)
     * Re-configure
     * Make sure pre-requisites are still valid
     * Update the following files:
       * pitivi/check.py: dependencies' version numbers
       * RELEASE: the release notes (or its short version)/announcement. To get the list of contributors, 'git shortlog -s -n RELEASE-<previoustag>..'
       * NEWS: a shorter version of RELEASE, with the exec summary of changes
       * AUTHORS: if there are new maintainers
     * Commit
     * git tag -a RELEASE-X_YY_Z  # For major releases, Z = 0
     * Use git push --tags to ensure the tags are published on the remote

Publishing (for both releases and pre-releases):
 * 'make distcheck' again to get the tarball
 * 'scp pitivi-X.YY.ZZ.tar.bz2 master.gnome.org:'
 * On master.gnome.org, run 'ftpadmin install pitivi-X.YY.ZZ.tar.bz2'.
   The tarball will appear on https://download.gnome.org/sources/pitivi/X.YY/ (also visible on http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/pitivi/X.YY/)
