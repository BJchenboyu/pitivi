0.13.3 Release "... we shall never (sur)render"
-----------------------------------------------

The PiTiVi team is proud to announce the third release in the unstable 0.13
PiTiVi series.

Due to its dependency on GStreamer, The PiTiVi team strongly recommends users have
all official latest gstreamer libraries and plugins installed for the best user
experience.

Title is from a quote by Winston Churchill “We shall defend our island, whatever
the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing
grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the
hills; we shall never surrender.”
