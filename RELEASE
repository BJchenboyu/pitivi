0.92 Release "Baby Steps"
-------------------------
This is the second alpha release for the new version of Pitivi based on GES,
the GStreamer Editing Services library. This is a incremental bugfixing release,
so make sure to also look at the 0.91 release notes to get the full picture:
http://wiki.pitivi.org/wiki/0.91

Detailed release notes for 0.92 are on http://wiki.pitivi.org/wiki/0.91

Please keep in mind that this is still an alpha release. That said, one month
after the 0.91 release and with the feedback we have received so far,
we are pretty confident that the new release series is of much higher quality
than the 0.15 series and older.

So try it out, let us know how well it works for you,
and report detailed bugs for issues you may encounter.

== Requirements ==

Dependencies/requirements have changed significantly since the 0.15 series,
but have stayed mostly the same since 0.91 (pyxdg was dropped as a dependency).

Refer to Pitivi's check.py for the dependencies' versions for this release.
See also http://wiki.pitivi.org/wiki/Dependencies for additional tips.
