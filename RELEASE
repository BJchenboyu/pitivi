0.11.3 Release : Paella Cubana
-----------------------------------------------------

The PiTiVi team is proud to announce the fourth release in the unstable 0.11
PiTiVi series.

This release series is not intended to be production-ready, but instead to allow
users to try more often new features that will be available in the next stable
series.

The developers will not be held accountable for any work lost, flooding or war
caused by this unstable series.

Due to its dependency on GStreamer, The PiTiVi team strongly recommends users have
all official latest gstreamer libraries and plugins installed for the best user
experience.
