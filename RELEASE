0.93 Release "Ra is a happy"
----------------------------
This is the third release for the new version of Pitivi based on GES,
the GStreamer Editing Services library. This is a incremental bugfixing release.

Detailed release notes for 0.93 are on http://wiki.pitivi.org/wiki/0.93

This is now considered a beta release. As per the feedback we've received since
0.91 and the many fixes we've made since then, we are confident that the new
release series is of much higher quality than the 0.15 series and older.

This release works well for us and we make nice movies with it.
Try it out, have fun and report detailed bugs for issues you may encounter!

== Requirements ==

For this release, we depend on GStreamer, GNonLin and GES 1.2.0.

Refer to Pitivi's check.py for the dependencies' versions for this release.
See also http://wiki.pitivi.org/wiki/Dependencies for additional tips.
