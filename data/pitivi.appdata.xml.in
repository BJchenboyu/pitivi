  <ul>
    <li>Accepts any file formats supported by the GStreamer multimedia framework</li>
    <li>Can animate hundreds of special effects and filters with keyframable properties</li>
    <li>Ability to set custom aspect ratios, framerates and rendering presets</li>
    <li>Easy to use crossfades and SMPTE transitions</li>
