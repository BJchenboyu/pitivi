"technical details. If you want to learn more about containers and codecs, "

"Basically, a container is what we typically associate with the file format. "
"Containers \"contain\" the various components of a video: the stream of "
"images, the sound, and anything else. For example, you could have multiple "
"soundtracks and subtitles included in a video file, if the container format "
"allows it. Example of popular containers are OGG, Matroska, AVI, MPEG."

"Codecs are ways of \"coding\" and \"decoding\" streams. Their job is "
"typically to compress data (and decompress it when playing it back) so that "
"you can store and transmit files with a smaller filesize. There are many "
"codecs available out there, each with their strengths, weaknesses and "
"peculiarities, and choosing the right codec with the right settings for the "
"right situation is a form of art."
